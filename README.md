## About
This webpage is used to showcase examples of a client-side webapp

## Recommended Tools
To get your site up and running with GitHub Pages, I recommend downloading:  
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for pushing/pulling to and from repos. This takes out the need to memorize commands.  
* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/): a text editor that lets you preview the results of your code in a browser.
