## About
This repo is used as a guide for publishing sites with GitHub Pages

## Recommended Tools
To get your site up and running with GitHub Pages, I recommend downloading:  
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for pushing/pulling to and from repos. This takes out the need to memorize commands.  
* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/): a text editor that lets you preview the results of your code in a browser.  

As for the language, you only need to know a bit of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) to get started. If you're up for something more advance, try out [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp).
